    A <u>programming language</u> is a system of notation for writing computer programs.
    [1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. 
    They are a kind of computer language.
The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), 
which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document 
(for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages 
(such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, 
with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.
